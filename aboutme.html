    Hello, my name is Patrick Hayden and I would like to be the next representative for District 56 to Wisconsin's State Assembly.  I live in Appleton with my wife
    Sarah, my daughter Cora and our cats and dog.  I have degrees in Political Science and Software Information Systems with a concentration in Pre Law.  Currently I 
    work for Thrivent Financial as a software developer which I've been doing for the last 15 years.  Along with being a software developer I've worked a number of other 
    jobs through the years including interning at the state court, waiting tables, and operating a blueprint machine.  When I'm not working I enjoy getting outside and 
    enjoying the outdoors with my family along with working with my hands.  I believe I have the experience to represent everyone in the Fox Valley and make you proud.
  <p>

    When I was growing up I was taught the value of hard work, I worked hard through college but struggled to find a job in the aftermath of 9/11.  After finding a job
    and having a successful career I've noticed many Wisconsinites still struggling living paycheck to paycheck or pay their student loans.  To them it doesn't matter how hard they work they aren't 
    being given the opportunities to have a career, own a house, or start a family.  These hard working Wisconsinites are why I'm running for State Assembly.
