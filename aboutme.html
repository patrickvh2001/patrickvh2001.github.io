    Hello, my name is Patrick Hayden and I would like to be the next representative for District 56 to Wisconsin's State Assembly.  I live in Appleton with my wife
    Sarah, my daughter Cora and our cats and dog.  I have degrees in Political Science and Software Information Systems with a concentration in Pre Law.  Currently I 
    work for Thrivent Financial as a software developer which I've been doing for the last 15 years.  Along with being a software developer I've worked a number of other 
    jobs through the years including interning at the state court, waiting tables, and operating a blueprint machine.  When I'm not working I enjoy getting outside and 
    enjoying the outdoors with my family along with working with my hands.  I believe I have the experience to represent everyone in the Fox Valley and make you proud.
  <p>
